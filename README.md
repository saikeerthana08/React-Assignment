#### Design Reference:

Please refer to the Figma designs provided for reference: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/file/CdQg7qzmPcEWGXZMzuHMh6/Assignment?node-id=0%3A1">View Figma Designs</a>

#### Features List:

1. **Category Panel**: Panel on the left side of the page that should display different product categories.
2. **Scroll Sync**: If the user scrolls the page, the category item should be selected based on the category list visible at the top of the page.
3. **Cart Functionality**: Allow users to add or remove items from the cart using `+` and `-` icons, which also act as toggle buttons. Update the cart count accordingly (_use Context API_).

#### Technical Requirements:

- Code should be written with reusability in mind, ensuring components are modular and maintainable.
- Scroll synchronization is a critical feature and must be implemented effectively.
- All necessary packages for developing the application have already been installed. If you want to use any other package, add the package in package.json explicitly and run `npm install` command.
  - For implementing scrolling feature, you can use `@makotot/ghostui` package provided in package.json.
